# Decentralized video marketplace app

- The project will consist of a dAPP that can be used as a pay per view platform for videos, like google play videos, using a crypto token, and open to anyone to sell its videos.
- Videos will be stored in IPFS and represented by NFTs.
- Content is encrypted using Medusa Project (https://medusanet.xyz/) and reencrypted to enable access to the users that pay to access the content (only authenticated users that paid for the content can get access to it).
- The dApp will consist of three smart contracts: an ERC721 token will represent the videos, an ERC20 token that will be used to pay for the videos, and a video marketplace contract, that will be used to create and access the content.
